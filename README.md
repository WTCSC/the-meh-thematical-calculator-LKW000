# Welcome to meh-calculator, who doesn't even have a choice but to help you!
This program is mean and a little bit lazy. However, they do know math better than anyone do!


### Running this whole thing!

1. Save the Code: Save the Python code (with the functions and main logic) into a file named meh_calculator.py.
2. Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Execute: Run the script using the Python interpreter: Bash python meh_calculator.py

Follow the Prompts: The calculator will prompt you to enter two numbers and the desired operation (+, -, *, /).

Rules are: You have to put in two numbers and pick the desired operation (+, -, *, /). The mean robot will say the answer! Just not so nicely...

### How to run the test on this program
1. To run the test, you will also need to install the pytest library:
   pip install pytest
2. To run the test, you have to navigate to your project folder in your terminal and type in pytest. After that, your test will either pass or fail.

If your test failed, then find the bugs and fix your coding. It is normal for your test to fail first.
If your test passed, CONGRATULATIONS
